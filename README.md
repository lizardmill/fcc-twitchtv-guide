I created this for FreeCodeCamp's Twitchtv Project. The original challenge
directed students to complete the project using Codepen and did not specify or
recommend a framework.

I decided to implement using React, which I'm just starting to explore. While
doing so increased the difficulty of the project, as I was learning the
framework as I went, I felt this project's scope loaned itself to React's
component system.
